;;; Commentary:

;; See the Spacemacs documentation and FAQs for instructions on how to implement
;; a new layer:
;;
;;   SPC h SPC layers RET
;;
;;
;; Briefly, each package to be installed or configured by this layer should be
;; added to `ap-org-packages'. Then, for each package PACKAGE:
;;
;; - If PACKAGE is not referenced by any other Spacemacs layer, define a
;;   function `ap-org/init-PACKAGE' to load and initialize the package.

;; - Otherwise, PACKAGE is already referenced by another Spacemacs layer, so
;;   define the functions `ap-org/pre-init-PACKAGE' and/or
;;   `ap-org/post-init-PACKAGE' to customize the package as it is loaded.

;;; Code:

(defconst ap-org-packages
  '(
   org
))

(defun ap-org/post-init-org ()
  (setq org-return-follows-link t
        org-hide-emphasis-markers t
        org-confirm-babel-evaluate nil
        org-todo-keywords '((sequence "TODO(t)" "DOING(g)" "|" "DONE(d)")
                            (sequence "|" "CANCELED(c)"))
))

;;; packages.el ends here
